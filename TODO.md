##[Back to README](README.md)

####Todo list for ECE 559 Project.
* 'o' means the project is being worked on, 'x' means it is completed.

#####To be completed together 4/32/12
1. Fix skybox textures (wtf is going on?)
2. Work on wrapping a variable texture to ball
 * this is a requirement
3. Discuss plans for shaders
 * Requirement to have 3 seperate programs
 * One can run step algorithm (LUT) 
 * One could run convolution (trivial)
 * I can do this as we discussed it in lecture today
4. After that go our seperate ways and code.
