To be completed together 4/32/12
   1. Fix skybox textures (wtf is going on?)
   2. Work on wrapping a variable texture to ball
      -this is a requirement
   3. Discuss plans for shaders
      -Requirement to have 3 seperate programs
      -One can run step algorithm (LUT) 
      -One could run convolution (trivial)
      -I can do this as we discussed it in lecture today
   4. After that go our seperate ways and code.
