##  CS 559 Spring 2013: Project #2

**Title:** Stadium Rush

**Authors:** Michael Vello Sartin-Tarm, Christopher Richard Aberger

**Project Description:** A webgl implementation of our stadium.

**Features:** The project features the use of texturing, mesh-built objects, 
 phong and flat shading, debug windows, and custom built shaders.
 The code in this project was created from scratch by us.

**Movement:**  To move through the maze use the up, down, left, right, keys in
 order to move forward, backwards, left, and right respectively.
 The 'a' and 'd' keys will cause the camera to look left and 
 right respectively.  Once you complete the maze you get GOD 

**Movement (God Mode):**
 mode enabling extra mobility.  Specifically 'i' and 'j' will
 allow the user to look 'up' and 'down' respectively.  The keys
 'w' and 's' will allow the user to move up and down.
